The players needs to destory the animatronics by placing down traps. When an animatronic touches a trap they 
will be destroyed. The behaviors of the animatronics (enemies) are as follows.

Freddy - Teleports to random locations on the map after a set time interval
Chica - Remains idle until the player goes within range AND IS NOT SNEAKING
Bonnie - Patrols the vents back and forward
Foxy - Runs to the player when they're not looking

Defeat all the animatronics for victory. If they touch you however, you will lose.
